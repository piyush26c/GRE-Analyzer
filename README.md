# University Prediction Engine🛫🌍

Developed a desktop 🖥 GUI application using Python programming language, PyQt (for frontend), and Oracle 11g(backend) database. The application predicts the most reliable University among the entered three choices, to which the user wishes to apply for higher education (Master's Degree only). 
Data visualization and handling of university prediction are key showings of the project.
